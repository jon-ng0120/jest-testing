Jest Practice

This is a collection of algorithims I wrote for reverse a string, capitalizing a string, creating an objects with calculator methods, a caeser cipher function, and a function that analyzes an array to provide the average, min, max, and length.

The main purpose of these is to practice using jest to write unit tests.
